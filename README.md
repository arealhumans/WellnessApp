# WellnessApp
Team 01 - Adam Payne, Alexander Dohms, Daniel Beatty, Von Brauner Souza

Our project is to create a mental wellness app to promote better lifestyle habits, rewarding stimulus for accomplishing tasks, and a functioning calendar to schedule time. The calendar will be capable of planning future events and checking them off once accomplished to trigger the rewards pathway. The research will be drawn from both similar apps currently available, as well as neuroscience resources and recent developments in depression combatants. The app will save its data on the phone for functionality off-line and will fulfill the requirement of personal development. We believe that the creation of this app will take approximately 6 weeks and will not require outside data.
